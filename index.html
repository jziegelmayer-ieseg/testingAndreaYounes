      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>I have been practicing the piano for 11 years, I also sing. It's a real passion, a hobby that relaxes me but which has also taught me to be very rigorous, to be a good listener, to persevere to get there. Indeed music and especially the piano, it is not something that can be done right away, it takes time, you have to train and rehearse. </p>
      <p>I also played tennis for 10 years, it was a way to let off steam and for me sport is something I can't do without. It's more than vital. Thanks to this sport, I developed my competitive spirit. This will to always want to win. In particular, I competed in a few competitions that allowed me to question myself and not give up when I lost but also to encourage myself when I won. </p>
